# Excel-Kickstarter-Analysis
An analysis of over 4000 kickstarter projects.  The analysis takes places between spreadsheets 2 and 5, where pivot tables, pivot charts, conditional formatting, and selection are used to take vital information from this large data set.  

The project showcases tools built into Excels GUI and how they can be used to analyze large data sets.
